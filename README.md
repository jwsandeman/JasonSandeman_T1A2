### Project Description
The purpose of the portfolio is website is to showcase my skills as web professional to prospective employer and hopefully catch their attention with my design styling long enough that they stick around to learn more.

Ive taken the simple single page approach (even though theres actually 5 seperate html documents) so as to give it the feel of never leaving the home page. This was achieved by using CSS animation and flexbox to create the effect. Users will be able to navigate around my website using buttons to navigate to my about me section, portfolio, blog and the home page.

I have chosen to use SASS to help streamline my styling in a logical and efficient manner. I have also used a font combination of Raleway and Lusitana that i found on this [blog](https://inkbotdesign.com/font-combinations/).



My sitemap is as follows:
